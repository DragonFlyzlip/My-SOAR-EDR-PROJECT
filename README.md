# My-SOAR-EDR-PROJECT


## Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution that enhances threat detection, investigation, and response within a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. By integrating tools like LimaCharlie for endpoint security, Tines for workflow automation, and Slack for alerting, this project aims to create a seamless and automated security workflow that reduces manual effort and response time. The focus is on building an efficient incident response system that detects threats in real time, automates remediation actions, and ensures security teams receive timely alerts with relevant context. Through this implementation, the goal is to gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity automation, improve threat intelligence handling, and understand how SOAR and EDR technologies work together to create a more proactive and resilient security infrastructure.

### Skills Learned


- SOAR Automation: Build automated security workflows using Tines.
- EDR Configuration: Deploy and manage LimaCharlie for endpoint threat detection.
- Incident Response: Automate detection, containment, and remediation of threats.
- Threat Intelligence Integration: Ingest and process IOCs for proactive defense.
- Security Event Correlation: Analyze and link alerts across multiple sources.
- SIEM and Log Analysis: Monitor and interpret security logs for anomalies.
- API Integration: Connect security tools for seamless data exchange.
- Slack Alerting: Automate SOC notifications for real-time incident updates.
- Playbook Development: Design response strategies for different attack scenarios.
- Cloud Security Operations: Deploy and manage security automation in a cloud environment.

### Tools Used

- LimaCharlie: Cloud-based Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) platform.
- Tines: Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tool for workflow automation.
- Slack: Communication platform for automated SOC alerts and incident notifications.
- SIEM (LimaCharlieâ€™s built-in SIEM): Centralized log collection and analysis.
- API Endpoints: Used to integrate security tools for automated data exchange.
- Webhooks: Trigger automated security workflows based on threat events.
- Threat Intelligence Feeds: Sources for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and threat data.
- Custom Scripts (Python): Used for automation, data parsing, and API interactions.
- Cloud Infrastructure (Vultr): Hosting environment for security operations.
